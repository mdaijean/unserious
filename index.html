      Hi, thanks for checking out my little website! My name's Ameenah, I'm a
      23-year-old aspiring Software Developer based in Detroit, MI, and I'm
      really excited to learn how to code professionally!

    <h2 id="start">How I Got My Start:</h2>
    <p>
      I think that, like most of my generation that developed a career affinity for
      software engineering, I came in contact with all of it (<em>HTML</em>,
      <em>CSS</em>, <em>JavaScript</em>) fairly early. Exposure to software
      engineering, IMO, was made highly accessible through social media
      platforms like Tumblr and MySpace, where a person could tweak the code of
      their blog (Tumblr) and profile (MySpace). Like I stated prior, because I
      grew up during the late stage of the social media boom, I think my coming
      into the Tech industry by way of software engineering was a preeminent
      thing.
    </p>

      I came across Grand Circus on Instagram via an alumni named Brea. Already
      familiar vaguely with coding through my teen
      years spending countless hours (in vain, usually, because I wasn't
      <strong>THAT</strong> familiar with software engineering as a whole<em>!</em>) trying to make my
      blog look pretty and whatnot, and innately curious, I signed up to take a
      Grand Circus Bootcamp Cohort and here I am! I'm extremely excited for this
      journey, too. At first it was anxiety-inducing, but I've gotten over that.
      It's time to utilize Grand Circus to assist in pursuing my dream career!
